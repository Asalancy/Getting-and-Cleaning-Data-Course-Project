The transformation from raw to tidy data was accomplished using the run_analysis.R file, an R function which takes the directory in which the source information resides as its only argument.

See "Source" section below for source files.

Transformations, in detail:
	The training, test data, and feature/label names are read using read.table
	The training and test data are bound together using the rbind() function
	Names are assigned to the data set
	The data set is isolated to only those features including "mean" or "std"
	More meaningful names are assigned to the dataset
	A second data set containing only the averages is created
	The two data sets are written to separate files named "tidy_data.txt" and "tidy_data_averages.txt"

Variables used include:
	trainData_x, trainData_y, trainData_Subject - data from the training set
	testData_x, testData_y, testData_Subject - data from the test set
	features, activity_labels - the names of features and activities
	totalData - the combined training and test data
	total_labels - the combined training and test labels
	total_Subjects - the combined training and test subjects
	meansAndstdsFound - a vector identifying features including "mean" or "std"
	meansAndstdsData - the data set resulting from applying the meansAndstdsFound vector to totalData
	meansAndstdsDataAverages - a second data set containing the averages of meansAndstdsData

This transformation utilized R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) -- "Sincere Pumpkin Patch"

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
